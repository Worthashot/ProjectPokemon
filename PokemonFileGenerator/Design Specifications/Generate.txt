DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Must alow user to
-Create a new valid map
-Edit an old map

CREATE:
go thorugh each paramater of a map
check each paramater to see if its valid
stores each paramater to a queue when written
after creating a whole valid map, writes the queue to file

MAP CONTENTS:
Name, what the file will be stored as
Dimention
Number of custom tiles
Each custom tile
map layout

MAP VALIDATING:
Name must be unique - will load a list of all other maps to check.
all other paramaters will be checked as standard.

MAP CREATING:
Each element of the queue will be checked by process above.
Each element represents a line of the stored map.
Writes each element as a new line.

EDIT:
alowes each paramater to be changed.
A changed paramater must agree with the paramaters it depends on
Changes are only made to file at the end and when all paramaters are valid

EDIT VALIDATING:
Each name must still be unique

A change in dimention must result in a change of map composition to the new size

A change in tile number must result in a change of tile composition to the new number

A change in tile composition may result in a change of map composition
	Will allow to remove any by selecting the one to remove
	will check for this

A change in map composition will not be alowed to resize dimention
	will be allowed to create new map or change individial squares
	This results in no other changes

Changes needed will be displayed after every action that returns user to paramater selection.

Will keep track of new input in seperate variables and will discard if calceled
	these new variables are checked when confirming a valid map is made

Will keep track of the changes needed by comparing the new variables to the old and displaying the conflicts to the user

EDIT NAME UNIQUE:
Keep track of all names and use this

WHAT TO IMPLEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function Generate() which create a Generate instance and ask for user input for paramaters.
Function Generate(...) which uses arguments for paramaters.
	these paramaters are mode and directory.

Function setMode(string) which sets the mode, edit or create.	(setter)
Function getMode() which returns the mode.			(getter)
Function askMode() which brings up the ui for selecting the mode and validates the input until a valid mode is selected.
	valid being edit or create,

Function setDirectory(string) which sets the directory.	(setter)
Function getDirectory() which returns the directory.	(getter)
Function askDirectory() which brings up the ui for selecting the directory and validates the input until a valid directory is selected.
	Valid being exists and correct form.

Function Create() which runs each ask paramater

Function setName(String) which sets the name	(setter)
Function getName() which returns the name	(getter)
Function askName() which brings up the ui for selecting the name and validates the input until a valid name is selected.

Function setDimention(String) which sets the Dimention	(setter)
Function getDimention() which returns the Dimention	(getter)
Function askDimention() which brings up the ui for selecting the Dimention and validates the input until a valid Dimention is selected.

Function setCustomNumber(String) which sets the number of tile types	(setter)
Function getCustomNumber() which returns the number of tile types	(getter)
Function askCustomNumber() which brings up the ui for selecting the number of tile types and validates the input until a valid number of tile types 
is selected.

Function setCustomTile(String) which sets the custom tiles	(setter)
Function getCustomTile() which returns the custom tiles		(getter)
Function askCustomTile() which brings up the ui for selecting number of custom tiles and validates the input until valid custom tiles are selected.

Function setMapLayout(String) which sets the map layout	(setter)
Function getMapLayout() which returns the map layout	(getter)
Function askMapLayout() which brings up the ui for selecting the map layout and validates the input until a valid map layout is selected.
